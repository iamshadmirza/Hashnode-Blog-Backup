## Customized CSS: another reason to love Hashnode more

So a few days back I saw @[Sebastian Gale](@seblz432) 's post where he talked about how he used customized CSS to give his blog a new look. But this feature was only available for hashnode ambassadors and I  wasn't one yet. But thanks to Hashnode, I got assigned the ambassador role on Hashnode last week which means I get to access new cool features. Among all, **Customized CSS** was the one I was most excited about. First of all Hashnode's UI is so good that I couldn't think of something I could change. But still, I spent some time and made a few little changes. Have a look around [blog.rutikwankhade.dev](https://blog.rutikwankhade.dev) ### 1. Header of the blogI felt there was more space in the header that can be reduced. So I changed it and made it look like a navbar. Again this is my personal preference.![Before-after.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613304500150/Ma6Tkfglv.png)### 2. Centered everything in the author area In mobile view, the elements in the author area were aligned left. So I made it centered.If you are changing a layout, be careful. There is a high chance you will mess with its responsiveness.![Before-after (5).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613325383437/M1AGvz6V7.png)### 3. Blog cards and background texture.This wasn't needed as the original UI is super clean but I did it to give it a unique look. While changing colors, don't forget to consider dark mode too.![Before-after (3).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613305786185/FlZMkTn2o.png)### 4. Styled load more buttonAny shade of blue and I am in. I changed the color of the load more button to my favorite color.![After.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613306344690/7OXHkxTgc.png)### 5. Rounded blog coverAdded border-radius to the blog cover and some margin to the top. Also, I reduced the font-weight of the title by 100 and reduced its font size on small screens.  ![Before-after (4).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613307070535/qzZx7T2qw.png)### 6. Cool colors for links.This is inspired from @[Vamsi Rao](@vamsirao) blog. I really liked this one.![After.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613308644405/G4S5UccR4.gif)### 7. Styled Quotes Why not add colors to the quotes, This has made the blog post more intuitive. ![After (2).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613313556738/N336VSimH.png)### 8. A little shadow on similar posts![screenshot - 2021-02-14T201053.911.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613313673909/S0eWh-TKn.png)> Now, it feels like ***my own personal blog***. I do have a blog I made a long time ago with Gatsby. Setting it up wasn't easy. But now that I have more than I wished with Hashnode. I don't think I need it anymore. I was going to share the code. But then I thought why not let you guys be a little creative and try by yourself. After all, it's just a few CSS rules applied to specific classes. By the way, it's only available for **hashnode ambassadors**. So if you are not, you might need to wait till it becomes public for everyone.Also, if someone from hashnode team is reading this, please let me know if I changed something I shouldn't.#### ✨ Here are a few customized blogs to check out.- https://blog.sebastiangale.ca/ by @[Sebastian Gale](@seblz432)- https://lo-victoria.com/ by @[Victoria Lo](@victoria)- https://catalins.tech/ by @[Catalin Pit](@Catalinpit)Also if you have tried this feature, drop your blogs below.
